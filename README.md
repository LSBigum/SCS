# SCS Wiki on Heartbleed

## Introduction

In 2014 a devastating security vulnerability was discovered in the OpenSSL implementation of the SSL/TLS protocol. TLS is a protocol that is commonly used to safeguard transactions being made on the web while it is also being used for e-mails, VPNs, voice over IP (VoIP), and more. In particular, when a website uses the HTTPs protocol, it means that the web page you're viewing has been transmitted to you in encrypted form, meaning that all data is supposed to protected from any kind of eavesdropping or prying eyes - and that goes both ways in this case. The confidential data being provided to the website - e.g. any passwords typed in - will in theory be encrypted, and be safe from someone trying to eavesdrop on you. In particular, what the 's' in HTTPs refers to, is that you're transmitting HTTP traffic that is encrypted by SSL. OpenSSL is an open-source implementation of the TLS protocol. It also happens to be the most widely deployed implementation. It is being used on notable open source webservers like Apache and nginx which, when combined, had a market share of more than 66% of the active sites in 2014. Anyone who uses the web on a daily basis is therefore certain to be interacting with an OpenSSL implementation, which makes this security flaw all the more severe. 

In OpenSSL versions 1.01 and up to 1.02 betas, there was a subtle but highly critical programming mistake that could lead to an attacker being able to gain access to the otherwise encrypted data. A system running one of the aforementioned versions of the OpenSSL implementation can be attacked quite easily. This wiki will describe both the attack and the flaw it exploits, as well as some of its ramifications. In particular, there's an extension to the TLS protocol known as Heartbeat. The Heartbeat allows you to keep a TLS session running even though no data has been communicated in a while, simply by sending a special message known as a heartbeat request. Before the introduction of Heartbeat, if there was a period without any communication between a client and server, the TLS session might have been terminated and would have to be reopened if any further data transfer was required. Heartbeat can also be used to check if the receiver of the signal is still present, and in that way keep the line of communication alive. The request itself consists of a payload containing the actual message, as well as some explicit information that specifies the size of the payload. The responding computer's answer will then contain the same payload and some padding. However, the vulnerability that went undiscovered for approximately two years, was that the computer receiving a heartbeat request would not check whether the information regarding size of the payload was actually accurate - it would blindly trust the information in the request. This allowed an attacker to send a very short message, for instance only a single byte of payload, while the message header informed that the payload actually had a size of 64KB. The code that handles the heartbeat extension within the OpenSSL library, simply copies the payload that the attacker provides into its memory.
