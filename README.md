# SCS Wiki on Heartbleed

## Introduction

In 2014 a devastating security vulnerability was discovered in the OpenSSL implementation of the SSL/TLS protocol. TLS is a protocol that is commonly used to safeguard transactions being made on the web while it is also being used for e-mails, VPNs, voice over IP (VoIP), and more. In particular, when a website uses the HTTPs protocol, it means that the web page you're viewing has been transmitted to you in encrypted form, meaning that all data is supposed to protected from any kind of eavesdropping or prying eyes - and that goes both ways in this case. The confidential data being provided to the website - e.g. any passwords typed in - will in theory be encrypted, and be safe from someone trying to eavesdrop on you. In particular, what the 's' in HTTPs refers to, is that you're transmitting HTTP traffic that is encrypted by SSL. OpenSSL is an open-source implementation of the TLS protocol. It also happens to be the most widely deployed implementation. It is being used on notable open source webservers like Apache and nginx which, when combined, had a market share of more than 66% of the active sites in 2014. Anyone who uses the web on a daily basis is therefore certain to be interacting with an OpenSSL implementation, which makes this security flaw all the more severe. This wiki will describe both the attack and the flaw it exploits, as well as some of its ramifications. 

## The Heartbeat extension

In OpenSSL versions 1.01 up to 1.01g, there was a subtle but highly critical programming mistake that could lead to an attacker being able to gain access to the otherwise encrypted data. A system running one of the aforementioned versions of the OpenSSL implementation can be attacked quite easily. In particular, there's an extension to the TLS protocol known as Heartbeat. The Heartbeat allows you to keep a TLS session running even though no data has been communicated in a while, simply by sending a special message known as a heartbeat request. Before the introduction of Heartbeat, if there was a period without any communication between a client and server, the TLS session might have been terminated and would have to be reopened if any further data transfer was required. Heartbeat can also be used to check if the receiver of the signal is still present, and in that way keep the line of communication alive. The request itself consists of a payload containing the actual message, as well as some explicit information that specifies the size of the payload. When the server receives the heartbeat request, it allocates a memory buffer according to the size specified in request message header, and stores the payload there. The response from the server will then be constructed by passing on the contents from the beginning of the buffer until the length specified in the heartbeat request.  

## Heartbleed bug

The vulnerability that went undiscovered for approximately two years, was that a computer receiving a heartbeat request would not check whether the information regarding size of the payload was actually accurate - it would blindly trust the information in the request. In the end, this was a rather simple programming mistake that allowed an attacker to send a very short message, for instance only a single byte of payload, while the message header could be manifactured to inform that the payload actually had a size of 64KB. When the response was being processed, the responder would simply look at its memory address for the request message payload, and would send back a message with a payload of the size specified in the initial heartbeat request, thus passing along whatever was stored in the memory afterwards as well. In the case of a heartbeat request with an initial payload of a single byte, but with a manifactured size indicating the payload is 64KB long, the response will then contain that same initial payload of one byte, as well as whatever happens to be stored in the responders memory next to the initial payload. This is known as a buffer over-read. The information being sent in the response could contain usernames, passwords, specific requests, credit card numbers, or even the keys that SSL was using to encrypt/decrypt data to and from its clients, thus allowing the attacker to spoof the identity of the website and thereby having easy access to any further data being transmitted. The reason that the information can be sent back in the first place comes down to the fact, that data generally stays in the memory buffer until it is specifically overwritten. Where the data is being written is rather impossible for an attacker to predict, and specific information can therefore not be targetted as such, however, the heartbeat request can be made as many times as is desired and can therefore quickly lead to plenty of exposed sensitive data. 

Even though the extraction of data is rather simple, the outcome is also random as mentioned previously. However, the process could in theory be automated rather easily by having a program look for patterns in the answer to the request.

## Heartbleed code

The implementation flaw that is the cause of Heartbleed can be seen in one line of code[4]:

`memcpy(bp, pl, payload);`

This takes a pointer to the source of the payload (`pl`) and copies the amount of bytes specified by `payload`, and stores that at `bp`. The destination memory gets allocated in a place where the data is allowed to be overwritten. When a response has to be sent, whatever data that has not been overwritten and is still within the allocated memory will be sent to the requester. 

### Leaked information
The contents of the leaked information can be separated into four categories[1][3]:

- *Primary key material*  
These are the keys used to encrypt the data being transmitted. Obtaining these will allow the attacker to spoof the identity of the website itself, making it easy to intercept future communication. Any previously intercepted communication encrypted with the same keys can also be decrypted. In order to rectify this, the owner of the service is required to retract the compromised keys and release new keys. 
- *Secondary key material*
This refers to user names and passwords to the site itself. The users will need to change their login information to secure themselves in the future.
- *Protected content*
This category encompasses personal and financial information, messages, documents - anything sensitive that would require encryption.
- *Collateral*
This covers memory addresses and other protective measures that can only be used temporarily, and thus they will become obsolete with new updates to the OpenSSL. 


Below is an example of a maliciously crafted heartbeat request to a server. This example didn't return any sensitive information, but could easily have done so - it would only be a matter of time before it did.

## Heartbleed fix

The fix itself was rather simple. First of all, a check is made to see if the heartbeat request is larger than 0KB. Next, the code checks if the payload size is actually bigger than advertised. The code can be seen here:

`* Read type and payload length first */
if (1 + 2 + 16 > s->s3->relent)
return 0;
/* silently discard */
hbtype = *p++;
n2s(p, payload);
if (1 + 2 + payload + 16 > s->s3->rrec.length)
return 0;
/* silently discard per RFC 6520 sec. 4 */
pl = p;`

One of the primary reasons to use an open-source implementation for security, is that anyone can look at the source code and find potential mistakes in order to get them fixed quickly. That notion falls apart, however, when no one is actually taking their time to do just that. Steve Marquess, the organisations president, said: 

"So the mystery is not that a few overworked volunteers missed this bug; the mystery is why it hasnâ€™t happened more often."[6]
